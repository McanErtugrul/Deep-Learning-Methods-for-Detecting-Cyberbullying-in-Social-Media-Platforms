# Deep Learning Methods for Detecting Cyberbullying in Social Media Platforms

In this project, it is aimed to detect cyber bullying in social networks with deep
learning and natural language processing techniques. The concept of cyberbullying, the
prevalence of cyberbullying, its impact on humans and its consequences were
investigated. Deep learning methods to be used in the project were researched and it was
decided to use CNN, GRU and LSTM models in the project. A dataset was collected from
three different platforms; Twitter, FormSpring and Wikipedia, containing a total of
144,000 sentences. Pre-processing processes, which are the basis of natural language
processing, are applied to this data set and the data are made available to the machines.
Later, models were created with CNN, GRU and LSTM methods, and 80% of the data set
was given to the models and training was provided. The models were tested with 20% of
the data set. Accuracy rates from the test results are supported by using metrics such as
precision score, F1 score and sensitivity score. In the experimental results of the study,
LSTM, the most successful model in cyber bullying prediction, and then GRU, and CNN
method were the last one.
